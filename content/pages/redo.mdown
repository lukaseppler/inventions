Title: Redo
Date: March 18 2012

Quite some time has passed since I last wrote something here. I was short on timeâ€¦ who isn't. But the real issue was that I did not have my writing process - no peace for it, it got no priority.

The interesting thing happened when I installed [iawriter](http://www.iawriter.com/). That is a simplified text editor which goes full screen and helps one ignore everything around - a simple white sheet, a nice font, and my brain. There. Nothing else to distract from writing. And so I started writing again, several articles - many of them are not finished yet, but I'm at it again. And I love it.

This blog is now hosted on a different server, different software, all new. There might be transition pains - but I think I do this thing some good by redoing it. I will have to tag and categorize again, and maybe redesign a bit. But there's time.

So my intention is to keep the name - inventions are still my pet topic. I have some non-technical discoveries though, about our brain and psychology. I have made a huge step for myself in the last five years - I'll talk about that, if I manage to keep my writing up, that is. I feel like I have a book in me to write, so much new, so much other people could profit from. I learned so much, I want to give back.
