Title: Self Printing Computers
Date: May 5th, 2006

For some time now, there are polymers used as semiconductors, as light emitting diodes (LEDs) or logic. As applications of this, many people talk about using this for flexible, roll-up displays. What’s a bit more recent is the idea to create prints using plastic semiconductors with an inkjet printer, see for example [IDTechEx: Inkjet-printed Polymer Thin Film Transistors at Epson](http://www.idtechex.com/events/presentations/inkjet-printed-polymer-thin-film-transistors-at-epson-000211.asp).

For me, the amazing thing would go a bit further. This technology could be used to create open source computing hardware.

Think of it like this: There would be a rack which can hold paper, and the corner of the paper is clipped so that it connects the paper to a bus. When you install a piece of software (open source perhaps) onto your machine, you are given the option to print some of its functionality onto a piece of paper (like a fourier transform extension, a number cruncher, a special shader for a game). This can extend the computer in a very specific way and allow a development of an ever growing bunch of specialized — or even general — hardware to solve specific tasks or even evolve in a computer on its own.
